* The Hackathon Project of the Team James Web3 for Aptos Seoul Hack 2023
### purpose
* social bridge to Aptos
* Bringing Ethereum-based social things (i.e. social graph, identity, subscription..) to Aptos

### problem
* Composability and self-sovereignty are two main advantages of blockchain-based applications.
* However, these advantages are also affected by the ecosystem of the blockchain. Currently, most dApps are on the Ethereum-based ecosystem, which means the non-Ethereum-based ecosystem is excluded from such advantages, although they could offer more technical advances. 
* There are some challenges to bringing Ethereum ecosystem to a multi-chain environment. However, most of those focus on economic items (such as tokens) or constructing infrastructure that takes considerable resources (such as EVM compatibility)
* As a result, there is no infrastructure in that builders can use Ethereum-based social items in a MOVE-based environment, although the decentralized social network apps are growing its popularity.
